Unsplash - Tumblr API playground
=======================

###Todos:
- ~~Add underscore.js and refactor js code for fetching when scrolling down the page~~ Thnx to **Amstel Beer** :beer:
- ~~Add more meta to each image~~
- ~~Add different size for images on small devices ( as fallback )~~
- Add more interactivity on scroll
- Add sliding effect, one by one image ( while scrolling )
- Make the app full-screen
- Make a jquery plugin
- Move to a **new house**
- Go to **Kenya** and **Morocco**
- Do you have other thoughts ?

[Unsplash.com](http://www.unsplash.com) redesign. Minimalist, parallax effect, but
still need to add more details for photos.


*PS: I know that tumblr API_KEY is free for all, maybe someday i'll create a proxy for this.*
